# Emotion Entrainment Log

## 2021/5/26
I am continuing to work with Andreas on standardizing our feature extraction and experiment methodology. That is bleeding over into this entrainment work, so I am continuing to update my code as he and I improve the AP entrainment analysis.

Some final brief thoughts on inter-annotator agreement, our methods of reconciling them, and how to move forward on a paper. I have a lot of experiments and results that I could write about, but this last piece of ambiguity has been preventing me from committing to anything yet. I'm curious if the below sounds good, and if it does, I don't have anything else standing in the way of finishing a paper.

Based on an analysis of inter-annotator agreement, I think it's OK to move forward on a paper summarizing and contextualizing everything from this semester as long as we do the following:

* When I do per-annotator normalization, I am normalizing on __all annotations they ever left__ regardless of whether we use them in analysis.
* Decide on some form of normalization technique. Based on the inter-annotator agreement spreadsheet, z-score normalization results in the highest agreement (admittedly still relatively low). This is assuming there is some other method I haven't tried yet which works better. Z-score normalization centers the result, so that will have an impact on quadrants if I put them in the paper.
* For global entrainment, __eliminate multi-turn annotations__. This will sidestep the issue of having to reconcile multiple annotations per turn, and should give us enough data.
* For local entrainment, __keep multi-turn annotations__. Only use the mean of the last annotations (for prompts) and first annotations (for responses). This is what I've been doing already and seems to do OK, and I think thI can justify it.

For local entrainment, __there are insufficient intra-session turn pairs__ for session-level analysis. I think we can only do summary statistics over the entire corpus.

I think if we ultimately decide to get more annotations and/or replace our existing annotations, it won't have much effect on this current research. My guess is that expanded annotation would probably coincide with resumed data collection, so this would fit in with any other pre-expansion work we do. Post-expansion, we could probably do some work related to our improved annotation methods (if we improve them), and use it as a case study for the impact of inter-annotator agreement on studies.

I did an analysis of inter-annotator agreement.

First, here is a visualization of the different annotators that I will include in any paper that comes from this. In order, they are CD, TL, VP, and their mean.

![CD Emotion](img/emot-cd.png) ![TL Emotion](img/emot-tl.png) ![VP Emotion](img/emot-vp.png) ![Mean Emotion](img/emot-mean.png)

I think I did this before but I couldn't find the older analysis. I look at how much annotators disagreed over the number of annotations per turn. For the most part, the majority of turns have 1 annotation. VP thought there were more annotations per turn than any of the other annotators.

| Annotator      | Mean per turn | Max per turn | 1 per turn | >1 per turn | Turns |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| CD             | 1.03          | 3            | 97.07%    | 2.93%        | 4536  |
| TL             | 1.123         | 3            | 88.35%    | 11.65%       | 4539  |
| VP             | 1.270         | 4            | 74.75%    | 25.25%       | 4484  |

Finally, I computed Krippendorff's alpha for the emotion annotations in a variety of situations that are relevant to the analysis we're doing. Specifically, those are:

* A blanket averaging all annotations. This occurs fully or partially in global entrainment. In this case, I computed Krippendorff's alpha for all annotations.
* Averaging emotions by turn per annotator. I do this in a few situations (the project work).
* Agreement at the first and last emotions in a turn. This occurs in local entrainment measures.

|                      | All  | Turn means | Turn ends |
|----------------------|------|------------|-----------|
| Valence              | 0.22 | 0.25       | 0.36      |
| Arousal              | 0.18 | 0.26       | 0.36      |
| Normalized Valence   | 0.25 | 0.30       | 0.39      |
| Normalized Arousal   | 0.18 | 0.33       | 0.40      |

The results are interesting. The highest inter-annotator agreement actually occurs for per-annotator normalized emotions at the beginning and ending of turns. This means that local entrainment measures should be happening in a situation with the highest agreement, and so should be the most reliable. Unfortunately averaging all emotions will be done in a way where they are averaged over the least agreement.

## 2021/5/5
Not much to report right now in terms of new metrics. Instead, I've been reworking my old tests with updated metric data that Andreas and I found, as well as with standardized turn exchanges. The results are in "emotion-entrainment-study.ods".

It is mostly complete, except for a few technical quirks that need to be worked out:
	* I realized Standardized non-adjacent turns aren't necessarily good to use for other distance here because a turn may not have emotion annotations, and would prevent it from being eligible. The danger here is that there won't be enough (~10) other turns for local similarity to average out the number. I'm going to make a separate set of baked-in random turn exchanges exclusively for use with emotion annotations.
	* All Pearson results need to have the permutation test done, and significance needs to be updated with Benjamini-Hochberg

## 2021/4/27

I've been working with Andreas to standardize the feature extraction process. From this point on, all features are extracted in line with the new process we developed.

This week I looked at whether speakers entrain on acoustic-prosodic features when experiencing similar emotions. This analysis differs from prior analysis in the following ways:

* Emotions were averaged over turns by annotator. Multiple emotion annotations per turn were reduced to a single emotion.
* Single turn-level emotions were normalized by annotator, then averaged together to produce a single valence/arousal value.
* Averaged emotions were reduced to quadrants.
	* 1 (↗): Positive valence, positive arousal
	* 2 (↘): Positive valence, negative arousal
	* 3 (↙): Negative valence, negative arousal
	* 4 (↖): Negative valence, positive arousal
* Turn pairs were selected based on emotional similarity. Instead of selecting adjacent turns, I found the nearest response turn uttered by the conversational partner in the same emotion quadrant as the prompt turn.

As before, I am looking at this from a high-level perspective and not investigating individual sessions yet.

### Similarity
I am still trying to figure out how to compute this, since previous conceptions of turn-level similarity didn't depend on a variable like the emotional quadrant. Some concerns:

1. Finding turns of the same quadrant not adjacent to the analyzed turn pair seems a little strange, since the turn pairs themselves aren't necessarily adjacent anyway.
1. Finding turns of other quadrants seems like a good idea, but there is overlap between the valence/arousal value (for example, if I'm in quadrant 1 and look in quadrants 2, 3, and 4, then there is some overlapping valence and arousal on turns 2 and 4). Because it covers such a breadth of samples, there might be a kind of increased regression to the mean that we wouldn't see otherwise.
1. Finding turns of the opposite quadrant also seems like a good idea, but in some cases there are so few turns in some quadrants (2 is especially rare) that it may not be worth it.

I have tried numbers 1 and 2 above and seen widespread dissimilarity (i.e., the partner difference is much larger than the other distance) across most features in both games and conversations. This may or may not be useful, and I didn't want to spend too much time thinking about it until I figure out what the best way to compute it is.

## 2021/4/20

I tried asking a bunch of different questions about emotional differences at turns not necessarily related to previous entrainment measures. Some of this may be a repeat of earlier metrics, but some are new.


### Is there a turn-level linear relationship between a speaker's emotional state and their partner's utterances?
"I have a high emotional valence. Does that mean my partner has high shimmer?"

Games summary: There is a negative linear relationship between valence and mean/max intensity and a positive linear relationship between arousal and mean/max intensity.

Conversations summary: There may be a positive relationship between valence and max intensity.

### Is there a turn-level linear relationship between a speaker's emotional state and the distance between their utterance and their partner's utterance?	
"I have a high emotional valence. Does that mean my partner and I are close to each other in shimmer?"

Games summary: No such relationship exists for valence. However, for arousal, there are positive relationships for mean intensity, jitter, and shimmer. This means that a high arousal is correlated with close proximity in mean intensity, jitter, and shimmer.

Conversations summary: no such relationship exists for valence. However, for arousal, there is a positive relationship for NHR.

### Is there a turn-level linear relationship between a speaker's positive/negative emotional states and their partner's utterances?
"Does a positive valence correlate with my partner's shimmer differently than a negative valence?"

Games summary: Positive valence does not correlate with partner feature values. However, negative valence correlates negatively with mean and max intensity. Positive arousal may positively correlate with mean intensity, while negative arousal may poisitively correlate with mean/max intensity and speaking rate.

Conversations summary: Positive valence does not correlate with partner feature values. However, negative valence correlates positively with mean and max intensity. Positive arousal does not correlate with partner feature values, but negative arousal correlates with max pitch and may correlate with mean intensity and mean pitch.

### Is there a turn-level linear relationship between a speaker's positive/negative emotional states and the distance between their utterance and their partner's utterance?
"Does a positive valence mean that my partner and I are closer to each other in shimmer than for negative valence?"

Games summary: Positive valence does not correlate with partner differences. However, negative valence may correlate slightly negatively with max pitch difference. Positive arousal may positively correlate with mean intensity differences, while negative arousal may poisitively correlate with mean/max intensity and speaking rate differences.

Conversations summary: Positive valence does not correlate with partner differences. However, negative valence may correlate negatively with jitter difference. Positive arousal does not correlate with partner differences. However, negative arousal may correlate negatively with max pitch difference.

### Is there a turn-level difference between partner distances originating from a speaker's positive emotional states and partner distances originating from a speaker's negative emotional states?

"Are shimmer partner differences different when I have positive and negative valence?"
**
Games summary: Starting with negative valence may have smaller differences in max intensity and shimmer. Starting with positive arousal has smaller differences in mean intensity and jitter, and may have smaller differences in shimmer and NHR.

Conversations summary: There are no differences between starting with positive or negative valence. Starting with positive arousal may have smaller partner distances in shimmer and NHR.

## 2021/04/13 Highlights
* Revisited old code, revised to make it more similar to the final B-MIC analysis code.
* Evaluated summary synchrony and local proximity on acoustic-prosodic features separately for positive and negative V/A

Starting a new log because the last one got overloaded with general entrainment work on B-MIC.

Some improvements since last time:
* General emotion entrainment measures are computed using speaker-normalized valence and arousal, computed over all V/A values from all annotators across all sessions for a single speaker.
* Turn-level emotion entrainmet is computed by comparing the mean of each of the 3 adjacent emotion annotations. If all 3 annotators left 1 annotation for a whole turn, then it is simply the mean of those 3 annotations. However, if an annotator left more than one emotion annotation, only the first/last annotation as appropriate is incorporated into the mean. This didn't make a huge difference in practice.
* Overlapping turns are skipped as they were in the original B-MIC analysis.

## Emotion/AP Distance Correlates
This section examines the difference between emotions and acoustic-prosodic features across turn exchanges. At turn exchanges where there is both an emotion annotation and a/p annotation for both speakers, we compute the difference of the emotion annotation and the difference of the a/p feature and compare them with Pearsons's correlation coefficient.

### Games
For game sessions, the difference in arousal is positively correlated with the difference in mean and max intensity, mean pitch, NHR, and speaking rate. The difference in valence is only positively correlated with a difference in max pitch.

### Conversations
There is no correlation between emotion difference and A/P differences at turn exchanges except for arousal and mean intensity (r=0.12351237225358844, p=0.03853251074475086, dof=280)

## Extreme emotion value entrainment
In this section, we examine the effect a speaker's emotional state has on his or her partner's entrainment behavior. We examine the emotion values in the first turn at turn exchanges, filtering out turn exchanges where the value does not pass a threshold value. The partner's emotional state is not considered.

### Synchrony
#### Games
For games, there doesn't appear to be a major difference in AP entrainment between positive and negative emotion values. Slight entrainment on jitter is present when valence < 0 and arousal >= 0, and there is no evidence for shimmer when arousal > 0. Entrainment on NHS is only present for arousal.

## Global Emotion Entrainment

### Proximity

#### Partner vs. other distance
For valence, partners are significantly more similar to one another than to others in games (t=3.8464652335977143, p=0.00035984515799359436, dof=47) and conversations (t=2.0910731874299846, p=0.04481099918776943, dof=31). There is no significant difference between partners and others for arousal.

#### Partner vs self distance
For valence, partners are significantly more similar to one another than to themselves in games (t=3.62211689045235, p=0.0007145391979325383, dof=47) and conversations (t=2.973186033431553, p=0.0056599846403571335). For arousal, partners are more similar to one another only in games (t=2.016626883693224, p=0.04946831753014236, dof=47)

### Convergence
There is only weakly significant global divergence in arousal for games. t=-2.623045586392091, p=0.015203616417768481, dof=23.

## Local Emotion Entrainment

### Proximity
At turn exchanges, speakers are more similar to their partner at turn exchanges than they are to their partner at other random turns in the session for every measure except arousal in conversations.

### Synchrony
I found synchrony is best viewed in summary, as it shows a pretty clear general trend. We get some nice graphs out of it, which is a little more intuitive to look at than just charts.
